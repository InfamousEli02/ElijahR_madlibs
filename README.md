# ElijahR_madlibs

In this project is an exercise that creates a MadLibs story. The outcome of this would be for the program to run on the browser and display both a **header** and the created **MadLibs story**. The code was created using a HTML file and a JavaScript file titled *"madLibs.js"*. Within the JavaScript, parts of the story were replaced with placeholder variables and a console.log() statement is included.
